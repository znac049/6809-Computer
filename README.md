This project is for a home-brew HD6309 computer system I am building. I used the 6809 (and many other 8-bit cpus) heavily back in the 1980s and still thing it is by far the best 8-bit cpu I have ever used. I never got the chance to use the HD6309 from Hitachi, which is essentiall a 6809++. That's where this project comes in.


## 3rd Party Code
I used Sean Conner's 6809 disassembler, which can be found [here](https://github.com/spc476/6809-DISASM), with only very minor tweaks, mostly to get it to assemble correctly using asm6809
